36037,"I am not an accountant, but I do run a business in the UK and my understanding is that it's a threshold thing, which I believe is £2,500. Assuming you don't currently have to submit self assessment, and your additional income from all sources other than employment (for which you already pay tax) is less than £2,500, you don't have to declare it. Above this level you have to submit self assessment. More information can be found here I also find that HMRC are quite helpful - give them a call and ask.","Ben bir muhasebeci değilim, ancak Birleşik Krallık'ta bir işletme işletiyorum.

35355,"""Depending on where you live in the UK, buying a house sooner might be a better option. I would echo the advice about putting some money away into a """"rainy day"""" fund etc. above but I know that in my area house prices are going up by around 7% per year. I bought a house two years ago and I'm paying 4% interest on my mortgage so I'm effectively making money by owning my house.  Given that you want to buy a house soonish, if your money sits in an account somewhere making no interest, you're effectively losing 7% of your cash each year by not keeping up with house prices, meaning you'll be able to afford a smaller house with the same money. Do bear in mind though that buying a house costs around £4k in lawyers fees, surveys, mortgage setup fees etc. and selling a house can be more since estate agents will take a % of the sale cost. If you live somewhere where house prices are not increasing as quickly then this will not be as good an option than if you live in e.g. London where house prices are currently skyrocketing. If you don't want to live in the house, you may be able to do a buy-to-let as an investment. Generally the rent will cover the mortgage payments and probably a letting agent/property management company's fees, so while you won't see any actual net income, the people renting will be paying the mortgage off and you'll be building equity on the home. It's not entirely without risk though as tenants can trash homes etc.""","""İngiltere'de nerede yaşadığınıza bağlı olarak, daha erken bir ev satın almak daha iyi bir seçenek olabilir. Yukarıda bahsettiğim gibi, ""yağmurlu gün"" fonu vb. için biraz para biriktirmeyi tavsiye ederim, ancak bölgemdeki ev fiyatları yılda yaklaşık %7 artıyor. İki yıl önce bir ev satın aldım ve ipotekimde %4 faiz ödüyorum, bu yüzden evimi sahip olarak aslında para kazanıyorum. Siz yakında bir ev satın almak istiyorsanız ve paranız bir yerde faiz almıyor, ev fiyatlarına ayak uydurmadığınızda her yıl %7'lik nakit kaybına uğruyorsunuz demektir, bu da aynı parayla daha küçük bir ev alabileceğiniz anlamına gelir. Ancak unutmayın ki ev satın almak yaklaşık £4k'lık avukat ücretleri, anketler, ipotek kurulum ücretleri vb. ve bir evi satmak, emlakçıların satış maliyetinin bir yüzdesini aldığı için daha fazlasını gerektirebilir. Ev fiyatları hızlı bir şekilde artmadığı yerlerde yaşıyorsanız, bu seçenek o kadar iyi olmayabilir, örneğin Londra'da ev fiyatları şu anda gökyüzüne uçuyor. Evde yaşamak istemiyorsanız, bir yatırım olarak satın-kiralama yapabilirsiniz. Genel olarak, kira ödemeleri ipotek ödemelerini ve muhtemelen bir kira acentesi/emlak yönetimi şirketinin ücretlerini karşılayacaktır, bu yüzden net bir gelir görmeyeceksiniz, ancak kiracılar evin ipotekini ödeyecek ve siz evin değerini artıracaksınız.

6724,"I used Oanda.com for Forex trading a couple years ago. I am in the US but I think it's available in the UK as well. At the time, they had no commissions and their spreads were comparable or better than other brokers. The spreads would just quite considerably when a big event like a Fed meeting or the unemployment figures come out, but I suspect that that is the same everywhere (or they have constant spreads and reject trades).  They did not push the high leverages like other brokers were at the time. I considered this to be very reputable, because though the profits to be gotten through 100:1 leverage are great advertising, the reality is that one unexpected spike and a newbie would lose a bunch of money in a margin call.","Birkaç yıl önce Forex ticareti için Oanda.com'u kullandım. Ben ABD'deyim, ancak aynı zamanda İngiltere'de de mevcut olduğunu düşünüyorum. O zamanlar, komisyonları yoktu ve yayılımları diğer aracılara kıyasla benzer veya daha iyiydi. Büyük bir olay gibi bir Fed toplantısı veya işsizlik rakamları çıktığında yayılımlar önemli ölçüde değişirdi, ancak bunun her yerde aynı olduğunu (veya sabit yayılımlara sahip olduklarını ve işlemleri reddettiklerini) sanıyorum. Diğer aracılar gibi yüksek kaldıraçları teşvik etmediler. Bu, yeni başlayanlar için beklenmedik bir sıçramayla bir marj çağrısı yapabilme ihtimalini göz önünde bulundurarak çok saygın olduğunu düşündüm. 100:1 kaldıraçla elde edilecek kârlar harika reklamlar olsa da, gerçeklik tek bir beklenmedik sıçramayla yeni başlayanların bir dizi parayı marj çağrısı nedeniyle kaybetmesidir.",True
38774,"""Most financial """"advisors"""" are actually financial-product salesmen.  Their job is to sweet-talk you into parting with as much money as possible - either in management fees, or in commissions (kickbacks) on high-fee investment products** (which come from fees charged to you, inside the investment.)  This is a scrappy, cutthroat business for the salesmen themselves.  Realistically that is how they feed their family, and I empathize, but I can't afford to buy their product.  I wish they would sell something else. These people prey on people's financial lack of knowledge.  For instance, you put too much importance on """"returns"""".  Why?  because the salesman told you that's important.  It's not.  The market goes up and down, that's normal.  The question is how much of your investment is being consumed by fees.  How do you tell that (and generally if you're invested well)?  You compare your money's performance to an index that's relevant to you.  You've heard of  the S&P 500, that's an index, relevant to US investors.  Take 2015. The S&P 500 was $2058.20 on January 2, 2015.  It was $2043.94 on December 31, 2015.  So it was flat;  it dropped 0.7%. If your US investments dropped 0.7%, you broke even.  If you made less, that was lost to the expenses within the investment, or the investment performing worse than the S&P 500 index.  I lost 0.8% in 2015, the extra 0.1% being expenses of the investment. Try 2013: S&P 500 was $1402.43 on December 28, 2012 and $1841.10 on Dec. 27, 2013. That's 31.2% growth.  That's amazing, but it also means 31.2% is holding even with the market.  If your salesman proudly announced that you made 18%... problem! All this to say: when you say the investments performed """"poorly"""", don't go by absolute numbers. Find a suitable index and compare to the index.  A lot of markets were down in 2015-16, and that is not your investment's fault.  You want to know if were down compared to your index.   Because that reflects either a lousy funds manager, or high fees.   This may leave you wondering """"where can I invest that is safe and has sensible fees?  I don't know your market, but here we have """"discount brokers"""" which allow self-selection of investments, charge no custodial fees, and simply charge by the trade (commonly $10).  Many mutual funds and ETFs are """"index funds"""" with very low annual fees, 0.20% (1 in 500) or even less.    How do you pick investments? Look at any of numerous books, starting with John Bogle's classic """"Common Sense on Mutual Funds"""" book which is the seminal work on the value of keeping fees low.  If you need the cool, confident professional to hand-hold you through the process, a fee-only advisor is a true financial advisor who actually acts in your best interest.  They honestly recommend what's best for you. But beware: many commission-driven salespeople pretend to be fee-only advisors.  The good advisor will be happy to advise investment types, and let you pick the brand (Fidelity vs Vanguard) and buy it in your own discount brokerage account with a password you don't share. Frankly, finance is not that hard.  But it's made hard by impossibly complex products that don't need to exist, and are designed to confuse people to conceal hidden fees.  Avoid those products.  You just don't need them.  Now, you really need to take a harder look at what this investment is. Like I say, they make these things unnecessarily complex specifically to make them confusing, and I am confused.  Although it doesn't seem like much of a question to me.  1.5% a quarter is 6% a year or 60% in 10 years (to ignore compounding). If the market grows 6% a year on average so growth just pays the fees, they will consume 60% of the $220,000, or $132,000.  As far as the $60,000, for that kind of money it's definitely worth talking to a good lawyer because it sounds like they misrepresented something to get your friend to sign up in the first place.  Put some legal pressure on them, that $60k penalty might get a lot smaller.   ** For instance they'll recommend JAMCX, which has a 5.25% buy-in fee (front-end load) and a 1.23% per year fee (expense ratio). Compare to VIMSX with zero load and a 0.20% fee.  That front-end load is kicked back to your broker as commission, so he literally can't recommend VIMSX - there's no commission! His company would, and should, fire him for doing so.""","
Çoğu ""finansal danışman"" aslında finansal ürün satıcılarıdır. Görevi, size mümkün olduğunca çok para vermenizi sağlamak - ya yönetim ücretleri olarak ya da yüksek ücretli yatırım ürünlerinin (ücretler size, yatırımın içinde tahsil edilir) komisyonları (teşvikler) olarak. Bu, satıcılar için kendileri için keskin, rekabetçi bir iştir. Gerçekçi olarak, bu, ailelerini beslemek için nasıl yaptıklarını anlıyorum ve empati duyuyorum, ama ben onların ürününü satın alamam. Keşke başka bir şey selseler. Bu insanlar, insanların finansal bilgisizliğinden yararlanıyor. Örneğin, ""getiriler"" konusunda çok önem veriyorsunuz. Neden? Çünkü satıcı size bunun önemli olduğunu söyledi. Öyle değil. Piyasa yükselir ve düşer, bu normaldir. Soru, yatırımınızın ne kadarının ücretler tarafından tüketildiği. Bunu nasıl anlarsınız (genellikle iyi bir şekilde yatırımlanmışsanız)? Performansınızı, size uygun bir endeksle karşılaştırarak. S&P 500'ü duydunuz mu, bu bir endeks ve ABD yatırımcıları için alakalıdır. 2015'i ele alalım. S&P 500, 2 Ocak 2015'te 2058.20 dolardı ve 31 Aralık 2015'te 2043.94 dolara düştü. Yani, düzeldi; %0.7 düştü. Eğer ABD yatırımlarınız %0.7 düştü, o zaman kârlı kaldınız. Eğer daha az kazandınızsa, bu, yatırımınızın içinde tüketilen masraflar ya da S&P 500 endeksinden daha kötü performans göstermesi nedeniyle kaybettiğiniz demektir. 2015'te %0.8 kaybettim, ekstra %0.1 masraflar nedeniyle. 2013'e bakalım: S&P 500, 28 Aralık 2012'de 1402.43 dolardı ve 27 Aralık 2013'te 1841.10 dolara çıktı. Bu, %31.2'lik bir büyümedir. Bu harika, ama aynı zamanda %31",False
9665,"In the United States you can't, because the average millennial in the United States has no opportunity to save money. Either you get a college education, then you will be burdened with a student loan. The cost of college education skyrocketed in the past decades. It is now practically impossible to enter the workforce without a huge debt, unless you are one of the lucky few who has rich and generous parents. Or you skip college. But college is the only way in the United States to obtain a generally accepted qualification, so you won't get any job which pays enough to save any money. As soon as that student loan is paid off, you need to get another loan for you house which you pay off for several decades.
