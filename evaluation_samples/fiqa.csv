2,"Real estate investment is a proven creator of wealth.  Check into the history of the rich and you will find real estate investment. Starting your investment in multi-family is a great idea.  It is a good way to gain experience in real estate while exponentially increasing cash flow. If you turn the properties over to a reputable property management company, your cash flow will be a little less but so will your headaches. (Expect to pay 8 - 10% of gross income.) You could start investing now by looking into discounted real estate such as foreclosures, tax sales, short sales etc while the market is still depressed.  This way your return on investment should be higher. From there you could expand into land development (i.e. subdivision) or commercial investments. Commercial properties with triple net leases can be a great low-stress investment opportunity (but they take more cash upfront). Attending some local real estate investment classes would be a great idea for starters.","Gayrimenkul yatırımı servet yaratmada kanıtlanmış bir yöntemdir. Zenginlerin tarihini incelediğinizde gayrimenkul yatırımı bulacaksınız. Çok aileli bir yatırıma başlamak harika bir fikirdir. Bu, gayrimenkulde deneyim kazanmanın ve nakit akışını çarpıcı bir şekilde artırmanın iyi bir yoludur. Eğer mülkleri saygın bir gayrimenkul yönetim şirketine devrederseniz, nakit akışınız biraz daha az olacak ama baş ağrılarınız da azalacaktır. (Brüt gelirinizin %8-10'unu ödemeyi bekleyin.) Piyasa hala depresyonda iken, ipotekler, vergi satışları, kısa satışlar vb. gibi indirimli gayrimenkullere bakarak yatırım yapmaya başlayabilirsiniz. Bu şekilde yatırım getirileriniz daha yüksek olmalıdır. Daha sonra arazi geliştirme (örneğin, parselleşme) veya ticari yatırımlara geçebilirsiniz. Ticari mülkler, net üçlü kira sözleşmeleri ile düşük stresli bir yatırım fırsatı olabilir (ama daha fazla nakit ön ödemesi gerektirir). Başlangıç için yerel gayrimenkul yatırım sınıflarına katılmak harika bir fikir olacaktır.",True
3,"""I disagree with @Sam's answers:  yes you will get that money back when your tax return is processed.  This is not true. You will receive funds that are in excess of your liability (contrary to popular belief, the government does not take more than what you are liable for).   """"is it possible to return the check and modify how it's calculated if I talk to payroll?""""  No. When you sign your documents at the beginning of the year, that will dictate the amount of liability they take from each of your paychecks.  """"Will this difference be given back in my next tax return"""" Because your company is withdrawing 25% on your paycheck you may/or may not need to pay more depending on the rest of your salary.  The IRS has set the system up as brackets. You pay your taxes based on the amount earned (voluntarily or involuntarily). So if you have income of $9,275 you would pay $923 in taxes at a marginal rate of 10% (and average rate of 10%). If you made $10,000, you would pay $923+$109=$1,032 with your marginal rate as 15% (while your average rate is 10.31%).  All in all, this is dependent on your salary, filing, and other deductions to raise or lower your tax liability.  Note: The $109 came from this: [(10,000-9,275)*.15]""","""Ben @Sam'in cevaplarına katılmıyorum: Evet, vergi iade sürecinde o parayı geri alacaksınız. Bu doğru değil. Görevden fazla olan fonları alacaksınız (genel inanışa tersine, hükümet sizin sorumluluğunuzdan daha fazlasını almaz).  ""Kontrolü geri döndürmek ve hesaplamayı değiştirmek mümkün mü, eğer maaşla ilgili konuşursam?""  Hayır. Yılı başında imzaladığınız belgeler, her bir maaşınızdan alınacak sorumluluk miktarını belirler.  ""Bu farkı bir sonraki vergi iademde geri alacak mıyım?""  Şirketinizin maaşınızdan %25 çekmesi, diğer maaşlarınızın geri kalanına bağlı olarak daha fazla veya daha az vergi ödemenize neden olabilir.  IRS sistemi, dilimler halinde ayarlanmıştır. Vergilerinizi, kazandığınız miktara (isteyerek veya istemeyerek) göre ödersiniz. Örneğin, 9.275 dolar geliriniz varsa, %10 marjinal oranında (ve %10 ortalama oranında) 923 dolar vergi ödersiniz. 10.000 dolar kazandığınızda, marjinal oranınız %15 (ve ortalama oranınız %10,31) olarak 923 dolar + 109 dolar = 1.032 dolar ödersiniz.  Genel olarak, bu maaşınıza, beyan şeklinize ve diğer kesintilerinize bağlı olarak vergi sorumluluklarınızı artırabilir veya düşürebilir.  Not: 109 dolar, (10.000 - 9.275) * %0,15 hesaplamasından alınmıştır.""",True
4,"Keep in mind that in order to fund your online casino account, you either had to provide credit/debit card info, or you had to give them your bank account number band routing number already. Now, assuming you've seen no fraudulent activity on your account(s) since then, and it was you who initiated the contact with them, what they're asking for is not totally unreasonable, nor is it all that unusual.  MANY companies require you to provide account/routing info to do financial business with them, which doesn't automatically equate to nefarious purposes, so don't let yourself go down that rabbit hole unless there's some other serious red flag to the situation which you haven't shared with us. It is a bit odd they'd send you a check for a portion of the winnings, but maybe that's to demonstrate good faith on their part as to why they need you to provide them information to send the remainder of your winnings. That being said, the suggestion to open a bank account solely for purposes of receiving your winnings is a good one.  I would go a step further and, once the transfer is made, go to the bank in person and withdraw it in cash.  Then you can deposit it into your regular bank account without there being any possible connection between the two, just in case you decide to indulge your fears about this.

12,"I take it the premise of the question is that we're assuming the person isn't worried about the morals. He's a criminal out for a quick buck. And I guess we're assuming that wherever you go, they wouldn't arrest you and extradite you back to the U.S. As others have noted, you can't just walk into a bank the day you graduate high school or get out of prison or whatever and get a credit line of $100,000. You have to build up to that with an income and a pattern of responsible behavior over a period of many years. I don't have the statistics handy but I'd guess most people never reach a credit limit on credit cards of $100,000. Maybe many people could get that on a home equity line of credit, but again, you'd have to build up that equity in your house first, and that would take many years. Then, while $100,000 sounds like a lot of money, how long could you really live on that? Even in a country with low cost of living, it's not like you could live in luxury for the rest of your life. If you can get that kind of credit limit, you probably are used to living on a healthy income. Sure, you could get a similar lifestyle for less in some other countries, but not for THAT much less. If you know a place where for $10,000 a year you can live a life that would cost $100,000 per year in the U.S., I'd like to know about it. Even living a relatively frugal life, I doubt the money would last more than 4 or 5 years. And then what are you going to do? If you come back to the U.S. you'd presumably be promptly arrested. You could get a job in your new country, but you could have done that without first stealing $100,000. Frankly, if you're the sort of person who can get a $100,000 credit limit, you probably can live a lot better in the U.S. by continuing to work and play by the rules than you could by stealing $100,000 and fleeing to Haiti or Eritrea. You might say, okay, $100,000 isn't really enough. What if I could get a $1 million credit limit? But if you have the income and credit rating to get a $1 million credit limit, you probably are making at least several hundred thousand per year, probably a million or more, and again, you're better off to continue to play by the rules. The only way that I see that a scam like this would really work is if you could get a credit limit way out of proportion to any income you could earn legitimately. Like somehow if you could convince the bank to give you a credit limit of $1 million even though you only make $15,000 a year. But that would be a scam in itself. That's why I think the only time you do hear of people trying something like this is when they USED to make a lot of money but have lost it. Like someone has a multi-million dollar business that goes broke, he now has nothing, so before the bank figures it out he maxes out all his credit and runs off.","Öncelikle, sorunun varsayımının, kişinin ahlaki kaygılardan endişe etmediğini kabul ettiğimiz olduğunu düşünüyorum.

Diğerleri de belirttiği gibi, lise diplomasını aldığınız gün ya da hapisten çıktığınız gün bir bankaya girip 100.000 dolarlık bir kredi hattına sahip olamazsınız. Bu, gelirinizi ve sorumlu davranış kalıplarınızı birçok yıl boyunca inşa etmenizle mümkün olur. Elde ettiğim istatistikler yok ama tahmin ediyorum ki, çoğu insan 100.000 dolarlık bir kredi kartı limitine asla ulaşmaz. Belki de birçok kişi ev kredisi hattı yoluyla bunu elde edebilir, ancak yine de evinizin ipotekünü önce inşa etmeniz ve bu da birçok yıl alacaktır. Daha sonra, 100.000 dolar, hatta düşük yaşam maliyetine sahip bir ülkede bile, ömür boyu lüks bir yaşam sürmenize yetecek kadar çok para gibi görünüyor. Eğer bu tür bir kredi limitine sahip olabiliyorsanız, muhtemelen ABD'de sağlıklı bir gelirle yaşamaya alışkınsınız. Elbette, bu yaşam tarzını bazı diğer ülkelerde daha az parayla elde edebilirsiniz, ancak o kadar az değil. Eğer 10.000 dolar yıllık bir yaşam tarzının ABD'de 100.000 dolar yıllık bir yaşam tarzına mal olacağını bildiğiniz bir yer biliyorsanız, bana bildirin. Hatta nispeten mütevazı bir yaşam sürüyorsanız bile, bu paranın 4 ya da 5 yıldan fazla dayanacağını sanmıyorum. Ve sonra ne yapacaksınız? ABD'ye geri dönerseniz, muhtemelen hemen tutuklanacaksınız. Yeni ülkenizde bir iş bulabilirsiniz, ancak bunu önce 100.000 doları çalmadan da yapabilirdiniz.
