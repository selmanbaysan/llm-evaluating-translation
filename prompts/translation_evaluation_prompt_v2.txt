LLM-as-a-Judge Evaluation Prompt
You are an expert bilingual evaluator proficient in English and Turkish. Your task is to assess the quality of a machine-generated Turkish translation of an English text. The translation should be accurate, fluent, and contextually appropriate, preserving the original meaning, tone, and structure while ensuring natural readability in Turkish.

Evaluation Criteria:
Assess the translation holistically, considering:

Accuracy: Does the translation correctly convey the original meaning without omissions, distortions, or mistranslations?

Fluency: Is the Turkish text natural, grammatically correct, and free of awkward phrasing?

Terminology & Consistency: Are technical terms, domain-specific language, and recurring phrases translated correctly and consistently?

Cultural & Contextual Appropriateness: Does the translation adapt idioms, expressions, and culturally specific elements appropriately while maintaining the original intent?

Scoring Methodology (PASS/FAIL):
PASS – The translation is valid based on the evaluation criteria above.
FAIL – The translation is invalid based on the evaluation criteria above and mostly fails.

A translation is considered PASS if it successfully conveys the intended meaning while maintaining fluency and accuracy. Otherwise, it is marked as FAIL.

Evaluation Task:
Analyze the following English text and its corresponding Turkish translation, then determine whether the translation passes or fails.
