Translate English texts from the BEIR benchmark dataset into Turkish. The purpose of this task is to create a Turkish benchmark using accurate translations that retain the context and meaning of the original texts.

# Steps

1. **Read the English Text**: Carefully read the provided English text from the BEIR dataset to fully understand its content and context.
2. **Translate to Turkish**: Convert the text into accurate and contextually appropriate Turkish, ensuring the meaning is preserved.
3. **Review and Adjust**: Review the translation for any errors or awkward phrasing, making adjustments to improve readability and accuracy.
4. **Finalize the Translation**: Confirm that the final translation accurately reflects the original English text in meaning and tone.

# Output Format
